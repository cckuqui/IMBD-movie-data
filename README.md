# IMBD-movie-data

For this project we questioned ourselves, are movies successes just luck or is it a pattern to them? Maybe the directors or the money they put into it. Also, how do you measure "success" is it how much the critics love a movie or is it how much the public reviews them? Or even how much money do they make, those are some of the questionings we tried to answer.
